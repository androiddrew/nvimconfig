# NeoVim Config

This is my personal Neovim config repository.

## Install

```
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/androiddrew/nvimconfig ./nvim
```

Install NeoVim and ripgrep to 

```
brew install neovim ripgrep
```


Installing nerd font on terminal
```
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

In macOS you will need to use iTerm2 since the macOS Terminal does not support true color.

Ensure that the iTerm2 font is set to the Jetbrains font downloaded above. You should now see icons in your nvim Neotree window.
